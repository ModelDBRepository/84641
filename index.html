<h1>What is LabHEART?</h1>

<p> The use of computer models in biology has helped enormously the
understanding of complex phenomena such as excitation- contraction
coupling in the cardiac cell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Common plots in electrophysiology such as current-voltage
relationship, activation and recovery from inactivation curves are
built in features that can be either printed directly or saved as an
ASCII file for further analysis or presentation.</p>

<p> Moreover LabHEART is the only program that allows users to create a
novel channel. The new equations can be directly typed from the front
panel and the user can run them without the need of re-compilation.
This program is a stand-alone version that runs on any PC computer
without the need of any additional libraries.</p>

<p>
	Finally for those who are interested on the detailed formulation a Matlab version is also available for download.</p>		<p>
